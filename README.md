## ‚ùì How to get Gemini

Gemini is an under development platform. I'm going to gradually release its services and libraries with open source licenses.

At the moment is reserved for selected companies with which I collaborate.

If you want to try it out or use it in your company you can reach me out on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreatarquini/) or open an issue here.


### ‚ö†Ô∏è Old Framework
In the last 2 year Gemini changed its architecture, from a Spring/Angular monolith approach to a Cloud Native and flexible one exploiting Micronaut and React. You can find the old framework on the [old-0.5.0 branch](https://github.com/gemini-projects/gemini/tree/old-0.5.0)
