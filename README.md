## ‚ùì How to get Gemini

Gemini is an under development platform. I'm going to gradually release its services and libraries with open source licenses.

You can find the ***REST API Geneator*** module in the official [Gemini Micronat Repository](https://github.com/gemini-projects/gemini-micronaut/tree/main)
with starters and other details.

At the moment the GUI modules of the framework (*Full React Admin Single Page Application* and *Low code Full Stack React Components*) is reserved for selected companies with which I collaborate.


If you want to try it out or use it in your company you can reach me out on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreatarquini/) or open an issue here.


### ‚ö†Ô∏è Old Framework
In the last 2 year Gemini changed its architecture, from a Spring/Angular monolith approach to a Cloud Native and flexible one exploiting Micronaut and React. You can find the old framework on the [old-0.5.0 branch](https://github.com/gemini-projects/gemini/tree/old-0.5.0)
